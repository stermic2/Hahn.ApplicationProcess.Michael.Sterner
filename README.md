# Hahn.ApplicationProcess.Michael.Sterner

Thank you for reviewing my application. 
I took the liberty of doing CQRS instead of repository because I wanted to showcase my dependancy injection skills as well as my library DynamicCQ
You will notice that the entire Data layer is missing. That is because it is injected from the autofac module.



Backend:

run docker-compose up
startup the app within Hahn.ApplicationProcess.February2021.Web using the standard setup.
The swagger ui can be found at this address:
https://localhost:5001/swagger/index.html

FrontEnd: 

cd to HahnApplicationFrontEnd/HahnFrontEnd
run 'npm start'

make sure to run npm install first.

Thank you for your time,
Michael S.
